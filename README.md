# üìñ [Math_Magicians] <a name="Math_Magicians"></a>

**[Math_Magicians]** "Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:
- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.
By building this application, you will learn how to use React. It also follows <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">Gitflow.</a>

## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Creating your first "React_JS" project

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

-A Git hub account
-Git bash
-Node JS
-React JS
-Visual Studio Code as your code editor

# Setup <a name="set-up"></a>

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone[(https://github.com/joyapisi/Math-Magicians.git)]
```
## Understand Set Up Requirements
Since this code is using webpack, you will run `npm start` in your terminal to run it instead of using the live server. 

## Understand Set Up Requirements

### Define React

<a href="https://react.dev/">React JS</a> is a front-end library introduced by Facebook in 2013 and it has become one of the most popular ways to build modern user interfaces today.

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm_xI7KntDs">The Story of React</a>

### Define Linters

A linter is a tool to help you improve your code. You can learn more about Linters here: (source: (<https://www.testim.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-heres-a-definition-and-quick-start-guide/>)).

#### Advantages of Linting:

1. Fewer errors in production- The use of linters helps to diagnose and fix technical issues such as code smells. As a result, fewer defects make their way to production.
2. Achieving a more readable and consistent style, through the enforcement of its rules.
3. Having more secure and performant code.
4. Having an objective and measurable assessment of code quality.
5. Having fewer discussions about code style and aesthetic choices during code reviews.

# Install React and Linters <a name="install"></a>

## Install React <a name="react-installation"></a>

- Follow the instructions <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">here</a> to set up react JS.

### Steps to Install React

- In the link above, go through these topics in order:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure">Folder Structure</a></li>
</ul>

In your project directory terminal, you can run these commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Install Linters <a name="linter-installation"></a>

Linters for various programming languages are available for use, e.g. Rubocop for Ruby or ESLint for JavaScript.

There are many ways you can integrate a linter in your workflow:

-text editor plugin
-GitHub Actions
-GitHub apps

### Steps to Install Linters

**Note:** The npm package manager is going to create a node_modules directory to install all of your dependencies. You shouldn't commit that directory. To avoid that, you can create a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it:

# .gitignore

node_modules/

**NOTE:** If you are using Windows, make sure you initialize npm to create `package.json` file.

```
npm init -y
```
_how to use npm: (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)._

## Install ESLint

1. Run

```
npm install --save-dev eslint@7.x eslint-config-airbnb@18.x eslint-plugin-import@2.x eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.x eslint-plugin-react@7.x eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.x @babel/eslint-parser@7.x @babel/core@7.x  @babel/plugin-syntax-jsx@7.x  @babel/preset-react@7.x @babel/preset-react@7.x
```  

2. Copy [.hintrc](./.eslintrc.json) and [.babelrc](./.babelrc)to the root directory of your project.
3. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**
   - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.
4. Run
   ```
   npx eslint "**/*.{js,jsx}"
   ```
on the root of your directory of your project to fix linter errors.


### [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) <a name="stylelint-installation"></a>

A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

1. Run

`npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x`

2. Copy [.stylelintrc.json](./.stylelintrc.json) to the root directory of your project.

3. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**

If you think that change is necessary - open a Pull Request in this repository and let your code reviewer know about it. 4. Run `npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"` on the root of your directory of your project.

5. Fix linter errors.

6. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** feel free to research auto-correct options for Stylelint if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!
