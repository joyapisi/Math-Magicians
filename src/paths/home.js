      This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in
      an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler
      tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the
      problem. Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations and the
      same boring mundane procedure.
